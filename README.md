# ASIC Sentry
ASIC Sentry is a monitoring software designed to collect and send operational logs
from Crypto Currency Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) Miners to
a central hub, [Mining Rig Monitor](https://github.com/nguyenvinhlinh/Mining-Rig-Monitor)

## Purpose
The primary purpose of ASIC Sentry is to provide real-time insights into the operational
health of cryptocurrency mining rigs. By collecting and sending log data from ASIC miners,
ASIC Sentry helps mining rig operators identify potential issues, optimize performance,
and improve overall efficiency.

## Features
- Log Collection : ASIC Sentry collects log data from various Crypto Currency ASIC Miners
- Data Sending : Log data is sent to the Mining Rig Monitor platform for real-time
analysis and visualization.

Customizable Filtering : Operators can customize the types of logs collected and sent to the Mining Rig Monitor based on their specific needs.
Real-Time Alerts : ASIC Sentry sends alerts to operators when unusual or abnormal log activity is detected, allowing for prompt action to be taken.

## Requirements
- Log Source : ASIC miners that support log collection (e.g., Bitmain B-Box, Antminer S19)
- Network Connection : A stable internet connection for sending log data to the Mining Rig Monitor platform
